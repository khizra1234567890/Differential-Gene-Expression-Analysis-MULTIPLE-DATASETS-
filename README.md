# Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-MULTIPLE-DATASETS-

# Gene Expression Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains tools for gene expression analysis using both R and Python. The scripts perform normalization, differential expression analysis, and generate visualizations like volcano plots and heatmaps.

## Repository Structure
- `data`: Sample data files or placeholders.
- `results`: Output from the analysis, including plots and processed data.
- `R`: Contains the R script for analysis.
- `Python`: Contains the Python script for analysis.

## Usage
### R
- Navigate to the `R` directory.
- Run `analysis.R` using RStudio or command line.

### Python
- Navigate to the `Python` directory.
- Run `analysis.py` using a Python interpreter.

## Results
Output from the scripts, including plots and processed data, will be saved in the `results` directory.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the scripts or add new features are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
